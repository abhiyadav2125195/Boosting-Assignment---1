    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique used to improve the performance of weak learners (typically simple models) and combine them into a strong learner. It works by sequentially training a series of weak models and giving more weight to the examples that the previous models misclassified. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all weak learners, often with weighted voting. Boosting is used for both classification and regression tasks."

During training, the algorithm keeps track of the weights assigned to training examples, giving more weight to the examples that were misclassified by previous weak learners. When making predictions, the final output is often determined by a weighted combination of the predictions of all weak learners. This weighted combination allows the strong learner to focus on the examples that are more challenging to classify, improving overall performance."
